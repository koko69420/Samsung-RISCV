## Task - 1
In this taks the basics of creating a assembly dump is explored.
For the first part of the task a c program is created where the program sums the numbers up to the pre-defined nth number.

The code is written in vscode's text editor instead of leafpad.

![Screenshot of first c program output where n=5](output_n=5.png)

In this first snapshot, it shows the creation of the c file and the execution of the program with output. This is for when n=5.

In this second snapshot, it shows the creation of the c file and the execution of the program with output. This is for when n=100.

In this snapshot, it shows the the output when the code is converted into assembly language.
The first snapshot is when it is set to 'o1', and the second is when it is set to 'ofast'.
